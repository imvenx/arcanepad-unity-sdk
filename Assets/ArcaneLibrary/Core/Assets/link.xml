    This section preserves the Newtonsoft.Json assembly in its entirety.
    
    WHY IS THIS NECESSARY?
    When building for WebGL, Unity tries to optimize the output by "stripping" unused code. However, 
    there are instances where Unity might mistakenly remove essential parts of libraries.
    
    In our case, parts of the Newtonsoft.Json library were being removed, causing runtime errors.
    To prevent this, we explicitly instruct Unity to preserve the entire Newtonsoft.Json library,
    ensuring its functionality remains intact in the build.
